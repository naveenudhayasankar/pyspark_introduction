# pyspark_introduction
A really simple introduction to Pyspark. 

The Pyspark Introduction notebook goes over the basics of Pyspark using the Metal Bands by Nation dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrpantherson/metal-by-nation) where different data preprocessing techniques are discussed. 

The Multi Linear Regression notebook touches upon the basics of machine learning in Pyspark by performing a linear regression to predict waiter tips on the Tips dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/code/sanjanabasu/tips-dataset/data).
